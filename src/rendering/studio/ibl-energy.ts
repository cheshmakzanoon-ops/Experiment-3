/**
 * Lighting & IBL energy (D03): one diffuse/specular split for the sky light.
 *
 * Diffuse sky light stays art-directed: `scene.environmentIntensity` is the
 * share of the visible dome that fills shadows and recesses (0.42 + 0.08 cover
 * by day). Specular reflections of the same dome must not be dimmed by that
 * share: a mirror shows the sky at the radiance the camera sees. Three.js scales
 * both lobes of `scene.environment` by one intensity, which left paint, carbon
 * and glass reflecting a sky at 28 % of its on-screen brightness. The shared
 * uniform `apexSpecularIBL = clamp(1 / environment, 1, 3.5)` multiplies the
 * specular and clearcoat IBL radiance after `lights_fragment_maps`, so specular
 * sky = environment × gain = 1.0 × the dome (night skies cap at 3.5).
 *
 * A material that owns a local probe cubemap (High, `ReflectionSystem`) is
 * flagged through its own `apexOwnEnvMap` uniform (`setOwnEnvMap`, a value, so
 * probe hand-overs never recompile): the probe already holds the dome at
 * specular scale next to lit scenery at its own radiance, so the gain is not
 * applied twice; its probe irradiance is divided by the gain instead, which
 * keeps the diffuse sky at the authored environment level.
 *
 * Diffuse sky colour balance: the linear Preetham dome is far more saturated
 * than real skylight. Its cosine-weighted clear-day radiance is about
 * (0.21, 0.54, 1.07), B/R 5, where measured clear-sky diffuse irradiance
 * (10-15 kK) is B/R 1.6-2.5. At the authored environment share that turned
 * sunlit asphalt lavender (B/R 1.10 for a neutral albedo) and open shadows
 * navy. `apexSkyIrradianceSaturation` pulls the diffuse IBL irradiance toward
 * its own luminance (energy unchanged), by lighting (`SKY_IRRADIANCE_SATURATION`);
 * specular reflections keep the true dome colour.
 *
 * The PMREM also gets a ground hemisphere (`SKY_GROUND_GLSL`): below the horizon
 * the sky shader returns the diffuse radiance of a ground plane of albedo
 * `IBL_ENERGY.groundAlbedo` under the same sun and sky, instead of horizon sky
 * radiance. Car undersides, lower sidepods and the floor then reflect dark,
 * warm ground the way they do on a real circuit. It is active only inside
 * `SkyEnvironment.capture` (`groundAmount` is 0 for the visible dome).
 *
 * Determinism: the gain is a pure function of the presented lighting state;
 * no time source, no randomness, and no extra draw call.
